In this tutorial I will teach some basic data wrangling steps and teach how users how to create a few simple visuals for that data. This blog will help students and other users understand the importance of data wrangling as well as introduce them to single data wrangling steps. I will be using data from the Los Angeles Lakers trying to answer the question of if home court advantage really helps teams win.\n\n\n\nThe very first thing that we need to do in answering the question of if home court advantage really helps teams win is to get clean and usable data that will show us trends and help us come up with an answer. The data set that I found contains quite a bit of information, such as points scored, field goals made, and free throw percentage. However, in this tutorial we are not interested in those variables. As part of data wrangling we can make the data a whole lot cleaner simply by eliminating the variables that we are not interested in. When reading in data using the “pd.read_csv()” function we can use the built-in feature of “usecols =” to select the columns from the dataset that we are interested in. Here you can see that I selected to use the columns “MATCH UP”, “GAME DATE”, and “W/L”\n\nimport pandas as pd, json\n\ncols = [\"MATCH UP\", \"GAME DATE\", \"W/L\"]\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"Lakers2009-2021.csv\", usecols = cols)\nprint(data.head())\n\n      MATCH UP   GAME DATE W/L\n0    LAL @ NOP  05/16/2021   W\n1    LAL @ IND  05/15/2021   W\n2  LAL vs. HOU  05/12/2021   W\n3  LAL vs. NYK  05/11/2021   W\n4  LAL vs. PHX  05/09/2021   W\n\n\n\ndata.rename(columns = {\n    'MATCH\\xa0UP' : 'Match_Up',\n    'GAME\\xa0DATE' : 'Game_Date'\n}, inplace=True)\n\ndef home_away(x):\n    x = x.strip().lower()\n    if \"vs.\" in x:\n        return \"Home\"\n    elif \"@\" in x: \n        return \"Away\"\n\ndata[\"Home/Away\"] = data[\"Match_Up\"].apply(home_away)\n\nprint(data.head())\n\n      Match_Up   Game_Date W/L Home/Away\n0    LAL @ NOP  05/16/2021   W      Away\n1    LAL @ IND  05/15/2021   W      Away\n2  LAL vs. HOU  05/12/2021   W      Home\n3  LAL vs. NYK  05/11/2021   W      Home\n4  LAL vs. PHX  05/09/2021   W      Home"
